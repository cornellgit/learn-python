# condition identifies a change of state
# 1. thread A waits for a specific condition
# 2. thread B notify this condition has taken place
# 3. thread A acquires the lock to get exclusive access to the shared resource.

# example, synchronized buffer with max size 10
# two fast producer, one slow consumer
